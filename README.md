# databakerNotebookInstall

For installing databaker from pre-downloaded files via a jupyter notebook.

## Instruction

1.) download as a zip

2.) Unzip the contents

3.) Drop the contents (i.e the folder containing all these files - make sure you dont have a folder wth a folder) into your documents.

4.) Open the jupyter notebook and following the instructions.

5.) Replace the structure_csv_default.py script in your local databaker installation (mine was in C:\python34\Lib\site-packages\databaker)
with the one provided in this repository.

NOTES: 

dont unzip the dependancies.zip file. There's no need.

step 5 replaces the default output structure (a rather confusing format used by the old WDA system) with a simple and concise one. You don't strictly speaking have to carry out this step to use databaker but I'd hihgly recommend it.
